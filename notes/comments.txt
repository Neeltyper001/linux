How we can add comments in a script

Bash Script Comments

Comments in Bash scripts are used to add explanatory notes to the code, providing insights for developers and readers. Bash supports two main types of comments:

Single-line Comments:
Single-line comments begin with the # symbol and extend to the end of the line. They are used for brief explanations within a single line.

Example:
# This is a single-line comment in Bash
echo "Hello, World!"

Multi-line Comments:
While Bash doesn't have a direct multi-line comment syntax, you can achieve the same effect by enclosing your comments within a pair of : (colon) commands, which are essentially no-op commands in Bash.

Example:
: '
This is a multi-line comment in Bash.
It spans across multiple lines.
It uses the : (colon) command for each line.
'
echo "Multi-line comments can be useful for explanations."
